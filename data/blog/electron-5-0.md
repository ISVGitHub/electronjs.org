## What's New?

A large part of Electron's functionality is provided by Chromium, Node.js, and V8, the core components that make up Electron. As such, a key goal for the Electron team is to keep up with changes to these projects as much as possible, providing developers who build Electron apps access to new web and JavaScript features. To this end, Electron 4 features major version bumps to each of these components; Electron v4.0.0 includes Chromium `...`, Node `...`, and V8 `...`.

In addition, Electron 5 includes changes to Electron-specific APIs. You can find a summary of the major changes in Electron 5 below; for the full list of changes, check out the [Electron v5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

## App Feedback Program

The [App Feedback Program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) we instituted during the development of Electron 3.0 was successful, so we've continued it during the development of 5.0 as well. To learn more about the App Feedback Program and to participate in future betas, [check out our blog post about the program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program).

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. [See our versioning document](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.
